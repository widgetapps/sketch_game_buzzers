# sketch_game_buzzers

This Arduino sketch file is the code to run a set of 4 push-button buzzers with a control unit that shows which buzzer was hit first and has a rest button.

This sketch file isn't very useful on it's own. Photos, schemdatics and a BOM will be provided when I get a changce - along with step-by-step instructions on how it all works. Hopefully the code us useful in the meantime.
